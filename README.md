House Price Prediction Project

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and more. The dataset used for this project contains historical data of house sales, which is cleaned and preprocessed before being fed into different machine learning algorithms. The goal is to achieve high prediction accuracy by comparing multiple models and selecting the best-performing one.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions, relationships, and correlations between different features.
Modeling: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
Model Evaluation: Using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to evaluate model performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Applying Grid Search and Cross-Validation to find the best model parameters.
Deployment: Instructions for deploying the model using Flask or any other web framework.
